This repository contains a variety of (mostly) small programming projects
for my Raspberry Pi.

In particular, the primary projects in here are:

* loop_images.py - A first cut at a TkInter program to loop through webcam images shot throughout the day.
* loop_images.rb - A RubyTk version of the same program. This one is more fleshed out

Since I am currently more of a Ruby developer than a Python developer, I expect that there will likely be more Ruby development occurring in here than Python.
